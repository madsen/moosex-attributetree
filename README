MooseX-AttributeTree version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}

This module provides inheritance of attribute values based on object
relationhips (instead of class relationhips), similar to how CSS
styles work in HTML.

MooseX::AttributeTree allows you to apply the TreeInherit trait to any
attribute in your class.  This changes the way the attribute's
accessor method works.  When reading the attribute's value, if no
value has been set for the attribute in this object, the accessor will
return the value from the parent object (which might itself be
inherited).
